            What is Portfolio Management?
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Think of your portfolio as your personal investment war chest.
            Portfolio management is the art and science of strategically
            choosing and arranging these investments to achieve your financial
            goals. It involves:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Understanding your risk tolerance: Are you comfortable with
              high-risk, high-reward options, or do you prefer a steadier, more
              conservative approach?
            </li>
            <li>
              Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset
              classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to minimize risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asset allocation: Deciding how much of your portfolio to dedicate
              to each asset class based on your goals and risk tolerance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rebalancing: Periodically adjusting your portfolio to maintain
              your target asset allocation, especially after market
              fluctuations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
            Why is Portfolio Management Important?
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Leaving your investments to chance is a recipe for disappointment.
            By actively managing your portfolio, you can:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Maximize returns: A well-diversified portfolio with strategic
              asset allocation can help you achieve your financial goals faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimize risk: Diversification helps shield you from market
              downturns affecting a single asset class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Peace of mind: Knowing your investments are strategically planned
              allows you to ride out market ups and downs with more confidence.

            Building a successful portfolio starts with a solid foundation. Here
            are some key steps:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Define your financial goals: Are you saving for retirement, a
              dream vacation, or a child's education? Knowing your goals will
              guide your investment strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assess your risk tolerance: How much volatility can you stomach?
              Understanding your risk tolerance will help you choose suitable
              investments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Research asset classes: Educate yourself on stocks, bonds, real
              estate, and other investment options.
            </li>
            <li>
              Develop an investment plan: This plan should outline your asset
              allocation, investment timeline, and rebalancing strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider professional help: For complex portfolios or if you're a
              beginner, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.
            </li>
